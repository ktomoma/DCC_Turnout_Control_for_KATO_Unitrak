# DCC_Turnout_Control_for_KATO_Unitrak
## Introduction
I installed a front view camera in a N-Guage train which can transmit the video image over WiFi. Newly released small ESP32 S3 based module "XIAO ESP32 S3 Sense" made it available in N-Guage train which has has a very limited space to install necessary hardware. 
Users are able to view the front view video image from a running train by Web server which runs on the ESP32 S3 processor over WiFi. The system is powered by a 3.7V battery installed in the car. 
I made two prototypes. In these prototypes, the system was installed in a very common box car which is 98 mm length. The car does not have a motor to run. Thus, the car has to be connected in front of an engine.
